    """Steady State Detection (CPD).

    Detect steady state periods in a time series based on a change point detection algorithm.  The time series is split
    into "statistically homogeneous" segments using the ED Pelt change point detection algorithm. Then each segment is tested with regard
    to a normalized standard deviation and the slope of the line of best fit to determine if the segment can be
    considered a steady or transient region.

    Args:
        data: Time series.

        min_distance: Minimum distance.
            Specifies the minimum point-wise distance for each segment that will be considered in the Change
            Point Detection algorithm.

        var_threshold: Variance threshold.
            Specifies the variance threshold. If the normalized variance calculated for a given segment is greater than
            the threshold, the segment will be labeled as transient (value = 0).

        slope_threshold: Slope threshold.
            Specifies the slope threshold. If the slope of a line fitted to the data of a given segment is greater than
            10 to the power of the threshold value, the segment will be labeled as transient (value = 0).

    Returns:
        pandas.Series: Binary time series.

    """Steady state (variance).

    The steady state detector is based on the ration of two variances estimated from the same signal [#]_ . The algorithm first
    filters the data using the factor "Alpha 1" and calculates two variances (long and short term) based on the
    parameters "Alpa 2" and "Alpha 3". The first variance is an exponentially weighted moving variance based on the
    difference between the data and the average. The second is also an exponentially weighted moving “variance” but
    based on sequential data differences. Larger Alpha values imply that fewer data are involved in the analysis,
    which has the benefit of reducing the time for the identifier to detect a process change (average run length, ARL)
    but has an undesired impact of increasing the variability on the results, broadening the distribution and
    confounding interpretation. Lower λ values undesirably increase the average run length to detection but increase
    precision (minimizing Type-I and Type-II statistical errors) by reducing the variability of the distributions
    and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of a TS to SS situation.

    Args:
        data: Time series.
        ratio_lim: Threshold.
            Specifies the variance ratio threshold if it is in steady state or not. A variance ratio greater than the
            threshold labels the state as transient.
        alpha1: Alpha 1.
