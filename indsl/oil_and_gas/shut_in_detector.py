    The shut-in interval is defined as the period when the valve is in closed state. The close state is determined based
    on the calculated manually-given threshold. The threshold is calculated based on the analysis of the valve signal
    histogram.

    Args:
        shut_valve: Shut-in valve.
            Time series with the shut-in valve opening.
        min_shutin_len: Minimum time.
            Minimum shut-in length in hours to be considered for detection.
        min_time_btw_shutins: Time between.
            Minimum time between consecutive shut-ins in hours to validate change of state.
        shutin_state_below_threshold: Below threshold.
            Indicator to tell the algorithm if the shut-in state is below the threshold.
        shutin_threshold: Threshold.
            Threshold between the valve open and close states. Defaults to None, meaning that the threshold is calculated.

    Returns:
        pandas.Series: Shut-in periods.
        Binary time series indicating open state or closed state: Open state= 1, Close state = 0.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If threshold cannot be determined in the evaluation window, the user is asked to increase the evaluation period. Recommended period is 30 days.
