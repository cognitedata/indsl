    """Gaps detection, Z-scores.

    This function detects gaps in the time stamps using `Z-scores <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score>`_. Z-score stands for
    the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score (i.e., an observed value or data point) is
    above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured. This method assumes that the time step sizes
    are normally distributed. Gaps are defined as time periods where the Z-score is larger than cutoff.

    Args:
        data: Time series
        cutoff: Cut-off
            Time periods are considered gaps if the Z-score is over this cut-off value. Default 3.0.
        test_normality_assumption: Test for normality.
            Raise a warning if the data is not normally distributed.
            The Shapiro-Wilk test is used. The test is only performed if the time series contains less than 5000 data points.
            Default to False.

    Returns:
        pd.Series: Time series
            The returned time series is an indicator function that is 1 where there is a gap, and 0 otherwise.

    Raises:
        UserTypeError: data is not a time series
        UserTypeError: cutoff is not a number
        UserValueError: data is empty
