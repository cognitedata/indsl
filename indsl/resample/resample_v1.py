    """Resample.

    This method offers a robust filling of missing data points and data resampling of a given sampling frequency. Multiple
    data resampling options are available:

        * Fourier
        * Polynomial phase filtering
        * Linear interpolation (for up-sampling)
        * Min, max, sum, count, mean (for down-sampling)

    Args:
        data: Time series.

        method: Method.
            Resampling method:

                * "fourier" for Fourier method (default)
                * "polyphase" for polyphase filtering
                * "interpolate" for linear interpolation when upsampling
                * "min", "max", "sum", "count", "mean" when downsampling

        granularity_current: Current temporal resolution.
            Temporal resolution of uniform time series before resampling. Defaults to None.
            If not specified, the frequency will be implied, which only works if no data is missing.
            Follows Pandas DateTime convention.

        granularity_next: Final temporal resolution.
            Temporal resolution of uniform time series after resampling. Defaults to "1s".
            Either "Number of samples" or "Final temporal resolution" must be provided.

        num: Number of Samples.
            The number of samples in the resampled signal. If this is set, the time deltas will be inferred. Defaults
            to None. Either "Number of Samples" or "Final temporal resolution" must be provided.

        downsampling_factor: Down-sampling factor.
            The down-sampling factor is required for the polyphase filtering. Defaults to None.

        interpolate_resolution: Interpolation threshold.
            Gaps smaller than threshold will be interpolated, larger than this will be filled by noise.
            Defaults to None.

        ffill_resolution: Forward fill threshold.
            Gaps smaller than this threshold will be forward filled. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        pandas.Series: Interpolated time series
        Uniform, resampled time series with specified number of data points.

    Raises:
        UserTypeError: data is not a time series
        UserTypeError: Either num or granularity_next has to be set
        UserTypeError: If specified, outside_fill must be either 'None' or 'extrapolate'.
