    """Butterworth.

    This signal processing filter is designed to have a
    frequency response as flat as possible in the passband and roll-offs
    towards zero in the stopband.

    In other words, this filter is designed not to modify much the signal at the
    in the passband and attenuate as much as possible the signal at the stopband. At the moment, only low and high pass
    filtering are supported.

    Args:
        data: Time series.
        N: Order.
            Defaults to 50.
        Wn: Critical frequency.
            Number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing one-half of the sampling rate (Nyquist frequency).
            Defaults to 0.1.
        output: Filtering method
            Defaults to "sos".
        btype: Filter type
            The options are: "lowpass" and "highpass"
            Defaults to "lowpass".

    Returns:
        pandas.Series: Filtered signal.
