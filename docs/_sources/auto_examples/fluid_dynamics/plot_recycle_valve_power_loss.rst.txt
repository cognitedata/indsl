Pump recycle valve power loss
=============================
This example demonstrates how to calculate the recirculation line power loss if you have the following information:

* Pump suction pressure
* Pump discharge pressure
* Recycle valve outlet pressure
* Recycle valve flow coefficient (:math:`Cv`) curve
* Density of the fluid

Note that if the flow rate through the recycle valve is known, the calculation can be simplified and the recycle valve
outlet pressure and :math:`Cv` curve are not required.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-20

We start by making some example dummy data. We ensure that the pump discharge pressure is higher than the suction
pressure, and that the feed pressure is not constant to get more interesting results.

To specify the valve :math:`Cv` curve, the type of curve has to be given and two points on the curve, the :math:`Cv` at min adn max
flow rates.

    type = "EQ"

The first step step is to calculate the flow through the recycle valve. We assume the pump discharge pressure is equal
to the recycle valve inlet pressure.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-57

.. code-block:: default

    Q_valve = flow_through_valve(
        discharge_pressure, valve_outlet_P, valve_opening, SG, type, min_opening, max_opening, min_Cv, max_Cv, True
    )  # m3/h

The second step is to calcualte the total head of the pump.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-65

.. code-block:: default

    den = 1000 * SG  # kg/m3
    den = line(start_date, end_date, intercept=den)  # kg/m3
    discharge_pressure *= 100000  # Pa
    suction_pressure *= 100000  # Pa
    head = total_head(discharge_pressure, suction_pressure, den, True)  # m

The last step is to calculate the recycle valve power loss.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-73

.. code-block:: default

    power_loss = recycle_valve_power_loss(Q_valve, head, den, True)  # W
    ax = power_loss.plot()
    ax.set_title("Recycle valve power loss")
    ax.set_xlabel("Time")
    _ = ax.set_ylabel("Power (W)")

As a simple sanity check, the increasing power loss with increasing valve opening makes sense, as this means more
fluid flows through the recirculation line.
